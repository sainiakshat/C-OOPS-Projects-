Hi, I'm Akshat Saini. When it comes to average programming projects, they typically start with defining the projectâ€™s objective, such as building a web app or automating a task.The process involves selecting a technology stack,
which could include programming languages like C, C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks for web development. The development process includes planning, design, implementation, testing, and deployment.
Projects might range from creating a simple website to developing a data analysis tool or writing an automation script. Managing version control with tools like Git, documenting the code, and solving common challenges are also important.
