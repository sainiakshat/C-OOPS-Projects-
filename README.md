Hi, I'm Akshat Saini. Average programming projects typically begin with defining a clear objective, like creating a web app or automating a process. The project involves selecting an appropriate technology stack, which could include programming languages such as C, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, and web development frameworks. The development process includes planning, designing, coding, testing, and deploying the project. Common projects might involve building a website, developing a data analysis tool, or writing automation scripts. Managing version control with tools like Git, documenting the code, and addressing challenges are also essential parts of the process.
