Hi, I'm Akshat Saini. I have a diverse technical background with skills in various programming languages including C, C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript, as well as experience in web development. Average programming projects I work on typically start with a clear objective, such as developing a web application or automating a task. The process involves choosing the right technology stack, including relevant programming languages and frameworks, and includes stages like planning, design, coding, testing, and deployment. Managing version control, documenting the code, and tackling common challenges are key aspects of ensuring successful project completion.
